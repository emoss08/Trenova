    Django command to pause execution until database is available.

    This command is used to check the availability of a database and waits for it to be ready. It uses the 'check' method
    provided by Django to check the availability of the 'default' database. If the database is not available, it waits
    for 'delay' seconds before retrying the connection. The delay time starts at 1 second, and is doubled in each
    iteration (up to a maximum of 60 seconds) so that the script doesn't retry the connection too frequently when the
    database is not available, which would put unnecessary load on the server. Once the database is available, the
    command prints a message 'Database available!' to the console.

        Handle the command.

        This method is called when the command is run. It writes the message 'Waiting for database...' to the console,

        If the database is not available, it waits for 'delay' seconds before retrying the connection. Once the database
        becomes available, the method writes the message 'Database available!' to the console.
