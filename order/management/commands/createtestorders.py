DESCRIPTION = "GENERATED FROM CREATE TEST ORDERS COMMAND"


class Command(BaseCommand):
    """
    A Django management command to create a specified number of test orders.

    The `Command` class provides a set of helper methods to create the necessary objects for the orders, including
    organizations, users, locations, order types, customers, equipment types, and job titles. It then prompts the user
    for the number of orders to create, and creates that number of orders using the created objects.

    Attributes:
        help: A string representing the command help message.

    Methods:
        add_arguments: Adds command line arguments to the command parser.
        create_system_organization: Creates a system organization with the provided name.
        create_user: Creates a new user associated with the provided organization.
        create_location: Creates two locations associated with the provided organization.
        create_order_type: Creates a new order type associated with the provided organization.
        create_customer: Creates a new customer associated with the provided organization.
        create_equipment_type: Creates a new equipment type associated with the provided organization.
        create_system_job_title: Creates a new job title associated with the provided organization.
        handle: The main method to be called when the command is run.

    This class is a Django management command that creates a specified number of test orders. It provides a set of
    helper methods to create the necessary objects for the orders, including organizations, users, locations, order
    types, customers, equipment types, and job titles. It then prompts the user for the number of orders to create, and
    creates that number of orders using the created objects.

    The `Command` class expects no arguments. The `handle` method is the main method to be called when the command
    is run. It prompts the user for the number of orders to create, and creates that number of orders using the
    created objects. It then prints a success message to the console.

    The `add_arguments` method adds a command line argument to the command parser. This argument is used to specify the
    name of the system organization to be created.

    The `create_system_organization` method creates a system organization with the provided name. It returns the new
    `Organization` object.

    The `create_user` method creates a new user associated with the provided organization. It returns the new `User`
    object.

    The `create_location` method creates two locations associated with the provided organization. It returns a tuple
    containing the two new `Location` objects.

    The `create_order_type` method creates a new order type associated with the provided organization. It returns the
    new `OrderType` object.

    The `create_customer` method creates a new customer associated with the provided organization. It returns the new
    `Customer` object.

    The `create_equipment_type` method creates a new equipment type associated with the provided organization. It
    returns the new `EquipmentType` object.

    The `create_system_job_title` method creates a new job title associated with the provided organization. It returns
    the new `JobTitle` object.

    The `handle` method is the main method to be called when the command is run. It prompts the user for the number of
    orders to create, and creates that number of orders using the created objects. It then prints a success message to
    the console.
