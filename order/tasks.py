    for each order in the provided list of order IDs, and updates the transfer status and transfer date of each order.

    If an ObjectDoesNotExist exception is raised while processing the task, the Celery task will automatically retry
    the task until it succeeds, with an exponential backoff strategy.

    The function expects the following arguments:
    - self: The Celery task instance.
    - user_id: A string representing the ID of the user who initiated the transfer.
    - order_pros: A list of strings representing the order IDs to transfer.

    The `transfer_to_billing_queue_service` function is called to perform the actual transfer of the specified order(s).
    If this operation raises an ObjectDoesNotExist exception, the function will retry the task with an exponential
    backoff strategy until it succeeds.

    Finally, the function returns None.
