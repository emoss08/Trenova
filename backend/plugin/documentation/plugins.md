# Plugin Management

## Overview

Trenova offers a streamlined plugin system, facilitating swift integration of new applications and modules without undue
complexity. Through the plugin manager, developers can readily install zip files from the Trenova Plugin repository on
GIT, which are then seamlessly integrated into the Trenova application. Moreover, the plugin manager empowers developers
to easily activate or deactivate plugins as needed, enabling swift and efficient testing without the inconvenience of
uninstallation.
