class Command(BaseCommand):
    """
    Django command to pause execution until database is available.

    This command is used to check the availability of a database and waits for it to be ready. It uses the
    'check' method provided by Django to check the availability of the 'default' database. If the database
    is not available, it waits for 'delay' seconds before retrying the connection. The delay time starts
    at 1 second, and is doubled in each iteration (up to a maximum of 60 seconds) so that the script
    doesn't retry the connection too frequently when the database is not available, which would put
    unnecessary load on the server. Once the database is available, the command prints a message
    'Database available!' to the console.

        Handle the command.

        This method is called when the command is run. It writes the message 'Waiting for database...' to the
        console, and enters a loop to check the availability of the 'default' database using the 'check'
        method provided by Django. If the database is not available, it waits for 'delay' seconds
        before retrying the connection. Once the database becomes available, the method writes the
        message 'Database available!' to the console.
