    using sympify. A check is performed to ensure that all the symbols in the expression
    are among the keys provided as keyword arguments. If the check passes, the symbols
    in the expression are then substituted with their corresponding values and the
    resultant float value of the expression is returned. If the check fails, a ValueError
    is raised.

    Args:
        formula (str): A string representing a mathematical formula to be evaluated.
        **kwargs (typing.Any): Arbitrary keyword arguments. The keys represent the symbols
            (variables) in the formula, the values are used to substitute these symbols in the expression.
