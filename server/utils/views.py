class ValidateView(APIView):

    The main responsibility of this class is to take in the provided request data and perform validation checks
    based on the specified step. The class could contain custom step validation methods, which will be used for complex validation.

    Each view using this class is expected to define the `serializer_class` and `step_to_fields` class variables.

    Attributes:
        serializer_class (Serializer): A Django REST framework Serializer class that is used for data validation.
        step_to_fields (Dict[str, List[str]]): A dictionary mapping each step to its relevant fields.

    Methods:
        post: Standard HTTP POST method. Perform validation depending upon the step provided in request data.
        validate_custom_step: Example method for a custom step called "custom_step".
            Can be used as a template for other custom step validation methods.
