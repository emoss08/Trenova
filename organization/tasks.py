    """
    A Celery task that listens for table change notifications from a PostgreSQL database and retries on errors.

    This task invokes the `psql_listener` management command using Django's `call_command` function, which sets up
    a PostgreSQL listener using the `psycopg2` library, and listens for notifications on the channels defined in
    the `TableChangeAlert` model. If an `OperationalError` is raised during the process, the task will retry the
    operation with exponential backoff.

    Args:
        self: A reference to the task instance.

    Returns:
        None.

    Raises:
        None.
