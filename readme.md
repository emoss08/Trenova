It is built on top of the Django framework and is designed to be easily extendable.

### Built with

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/) - Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages
rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

### Style Guides

We use the follow style guides to ensure consistency across the codebase.

- [Django Coding Style](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/) -
  Primary style guide for the backend.
- [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)  - Primary style guide for the
  docstrings.
- [Hacksoft Django Style Guide](https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide) - Secondary style guide for the
  backend.

Note - We only use certain parts of each style guide. Of course, we try our best to follow the style guides as much as
possible.
However, we do not follow the style guides to the letter.

### Formatting

  separated into sections and by type.

- [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) - A Python code static checker.

### Testing
