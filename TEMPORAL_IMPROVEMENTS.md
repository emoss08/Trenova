# Temporal Implementation Improvements

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of Temporal improvements for the Trenova TMS application. Each improvement is organized by priority with checkboxes to track completion.

## ðŸ”´ High Priority (Immediate Impact)

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling & Activity Resilience

- [x] Create custom error types package (`temporaljobs/errors`)
  - [x] Define `ApplicationError` wrapper
  - [x] Add `NonRetryableError` type
  - [x] Add `RetryableError` type with backoff hints
  - [x] Create error classification helpers
- [x] Update shipment activities with new error types
  - [x] `DuplicateShipmentActivity`
  - [x] `CancelShipmentsByCreatedAtActivity`
- [x] Update notification activities with new error types
  - [x] `SendNotificationActivity`
  - [x] `SendConfigurationCopiedNotificationActivity`
- [x] Update system activities with new error types
  - [x] `DeleteAuditEntriesActivity`
- [x] Add structured error logging with context
- [x] Implement proper error classification and retry logic

### 2. Optimize Worker Configuration

- [x] Update shipment worker configuration
  - [x] Set `MaxConcurrentActivityExecutionSize`
  - [x] Set `MaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskExecutionSize`
  - [x] Configure `WorkerActivitiesPerSecond` rate limiting
  - [x] Enable sticky execution with `StickyScheduleToStartTimeout`
- [x] Update notification worker configuration
  - [x] Configuration available via config.yaml
- [x] Update system worker configuration
  - [x] Configuration available via config.yaml
- [x] Add worker metrics configuration
- [x] Create worker tuning documentation
- [x] Add environment-based configuration (dev/staging/prod)

## ðŸŸ¢ Lower Priority (Nice to Have)

### 3. Schedule Enhancements

- [x] Add schedule pause/resume API
  - [x] Create schedule management methods (PauseSchedule, UnpauseSchedule)
  - [x] Add manual trigger capability (TriggerSchedule)
- [x] Dynamic schedule updates
  - [x] Allow cron expression updates (UpdateScheduleCron)
  - [x] Support schedule metadata and descriptions
- [x] Add schedule monitoring methods
  - [x] GetScheduleInfo for individual schedules
  - [x] ListSchedules for all schedules
- [x] Enhanced schedule configuration
  - [x] Centralized schedule definitions
  - [x] Auto-update existing schedules on startup

### 4. Continue-As-New for Long-Running Workflows

- [x] Identified that current workflows don't need continue-as-new
  - DeleteAuditEntriesWorkflow runs once per schedule
  - CancelShipmentsByCreatedAtWorkflow runs once per schedule
  - No workflows have long-running loops or accumulate large histories
- Note: Continue-As-New should be implemented when:
  - Workflows run for extended periods (days/weeks)
  - Processing large datasets in loops
  - History exceeds 10,000 events

### 5. Data Converter for Security

- [x] Implement encryption data converter
  - [x] AES-256-GCM encryption for payloads
  - [x] Key ID support for multiple keys
  - [x] Environment variable based key storage
- [x] Add compression data converter
  - [x] GZIP compression for large payloads
  - [x] Selective compression based on configurable threshold
- [x] Create codec-based converter implementation
  - [x] Uses Temporal's PayloadCodec interface
  - [x] Chainable codecs (compression + encryption)
- [x] Add converter configuration management
  - [x] Configuration via config.yaml
  - [x] Enable/disable encryption and compression
  - [x] Configurable compression threshold

### 7. Dynamic Worker Scaling

- [ ] Implement worker identity system
- [ ] Create task queue routing logic
  - [ ] Priority-based routing
  - [ ] Load-based routing
- [ ] Add worker auto-scaling triggers
- [ ] Create worker pool management service

## Quick Wins

- [ ] Add more heartbeat recording points in activities
- [ ] Improve activity timeout configurations
- [ ] Add descriptive workflow/activity names
- [ ] Add workflow execution tags
- [ ] Improve error messages

## Testing Requirements

- [x] Unit tests for all new error types
- [ ] Performance tests for worker optimizations
- [ ] Signal handling tests

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update README with new Temporal features
- [ ] Create Temporal best practices guide
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Create operation runbooks

## Implementation Notes

### Current Implementation Status

- **Date Started**: 2025-08-30
- **Target Completion**: TBD
- **Team Members**: TBD

### Dependencies

- Temporal SDK version: (check go.mod)
- Go version: 1.24+
- Additional packages needed:
  - OpenTelemetry (for metrics)
  - Encryption libraries (for data converter)

### Rollout Strategy

1. Development environment testing
2. Staging deployment with monitoring
3. Gradual production rollout
4. Monitor metrics and adjust configurations

### Risk Mitigation

- All changes must be backward compatible
- Test with in-flight workflows before deployment
- Have rollback plan for each change
- Monitor worker performance after changes

## Progress Tracking

### Week 1

- [x] Complete high-priority error handling
