  - [x] Set `MaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskExecutionSize`
  - [x] Configure `WorkerActivitiesPerSecond` rate limiting
  - [x] Enable sticky execution with `StickyScheduleToStartTimeout`
- [x] Update notification worker configuration
  - [x] Configuration available via config.yaml
- [x] Update system worker configuration
  - [x] Configuration available via config.yaml
- [x] Add worker metrics configuration
- [x] Create worker tuning documentation
- [x] Add environment-based configuration (dev/staging/prod)

## ðŸŸ¢ Lower Priority (Nice to Have)

### 4. Schedule Enhancements

- [ ] Add schedule pause/resume API
  - [ ] Create schedule management service
  - [ ] Add REST endpoints for schedule control
- [ ] Implement schedule backfill
  - [ ] Add backfill command for missed executions
  - [ ] Create backfill UI component
- [ ] Dynamic schedule updates
  - [ ] Allow cron expression updates
  - [ ] Support timezone changes
- [ ] Add schedule monitoring dashboard

### 5. Continue-As-New for Long-Running Workflows

- [ ] Identify workflows needing continue-as-new
- [ ] Implement in data retention workflows
- [ ] Add history size monitoring
- [ ] Create continue-as-new guidelines

### 6. Data Converter for Security

- [ ] Implement encryption data converter
  - [ ] AES-256 encryption for payloads
  - [ ] Key rotation support
- [ ] Add compression data converter
  - [ ] GZIP compression for large payloads
  - [ ] Selective compression based on size
- [ ] Create converter chain for multiple transformations
- [ ] Add converter configuration management

### 7. Dynamic Worker Scaling

- [ ] Implement worker identity system
- [ ] Create task queue routing logic
  - [ ] Priority-based routing
  - [ ] Load-based routing
- [ ] Add worker auto-scaling triggers
- [ ] Create worker pool management service

## Quick Wins

- [ ] Add more heartbeat recording points in activities
- [ ] Improve activity timeout configurations
- [ ] Add descriptive workflow/activity names
- [ ] Add workflow execution tags
- [ ] Improve error messages

## Testing Requirements

- [x] Unit tests for all new error types
- [ ] Performance tests for worker optimizations
- [ ] Signal handling tests

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update README with new Temporal features
- [ ] Create Temporal best practices guide
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Create operation runbooks

## Implementation Notes

### Current Implementation Status

- **Date Started**: 2025-08-30
- **Target Completion**: TBD
- **Team Members**: TBD

### Dependencies

- Temporal SDK version: (check go.mod)
- Go version: 1.24+
- Additional packages needed:
  - OpenTelemetry (for metrics)
  - Encryption libraries (for data converter)

### Rollout Strategy

1. Development environment testing
2. Staging deployment with monitoring
3. Gradual production rollout
4. Monitor metrics and adjust configurations

### Risk Mitigation

- All changes must be backward compatible
- Test with in-flight workflows before deployment
- Have rollback plan for each change
- Monitor worker performance after changes

## Progress Tracking

### Week 1

- [x] Complete high-priority error handling

### Week 2

- [ ] Optimize worker configurations
- [ ] Begin saga pattern implementation

### Week 3

- [ ] Complete saga pattern
- [ ] Add workflow versioning

### Week 4

- [ ] Implement signals and updates
- [ ] Add metrics and observability

## Notes and Decisions

- Add any architectural decisions here
- Document any deviations from the plan
- Record performance improvements observed
