    This function takes an instance of the Organization model representing the organization associated with the order, as well

    The function first retrieves the organization's route_control attribute to determine which method to use for calculating
    the distance. If the distance_method is set to GOOGLE, the function uses the Google Distance Matrix API to retrieve the
    distance and duration between the two points. Otherwise, the function calculates the distance using the geodesic() function
    from the geopy library, which implements the Haversine formula.
