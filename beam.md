# Monta Beam: A Specialized AI-driven Natural Language Processing Tool

Monta Beam represents a state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing tool, powered by Artificial Intelligence technology. Drawing its
inspiration from OpenAI's ChatGPT, Monta Beam offers a unique specialization by being trained exclusively on transportation-specific
data such as FMCSA rules and regulations. This specialization enables users to direct inquiries within their system,
eliminating the need for manual document searches.

What sets Monta Beam apart is its capability to perform function calls, thereby allowing users to exploit their system's potential to its fullest.
An illustration of this functionality is exemplified in the question: "Can you execute the driver feasibility tool for Order ORD0021231 and identify
the most suitable driver for this order?". In response, Beam would run the driver feasibility tool for the mentioned order, assess all drivers
within the Monta application, and provide you with the results.

But that's not all. Monta Beam continually evolves, learning from your application data and acquiring the capacity
to answer and perform specific actions within your system. An example of such an action could be: "Could you bill Order ORD0021231 to the customer?".
In response to this, Beam would carry out the billing process, providing alerts for any missing billing requirements. This continuous learning and
adaptability make Monta Beam an indispensable tool in leveraging the capabilities of your system.

In essence, Beam stands as a testament to Monta's unwavering commitment to furnishing your business with the most innovative technologies, enabling
operations that are both efficient and secure.
