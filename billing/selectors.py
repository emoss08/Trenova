    The billable orders are determined based on the `order_transfer_criteria`
    set on the organization's `BillingControl` instance. If the
    `order_transfer_criteria` is set to `READY_AND_COMPLETED`, orders that are
    both ready to bill and have a status of `COMPLETED` will be returned. If the

    `COMPLETED` will be returned. If the `order_transfer_criteria` is set to
    `READY_TO_BILL`, orders that are ready to bill will be returned.

    Args:
        organization: The organization for which billable orders should be returned.

    Returns:
        An iterator of billable orders for the organization, or `None` if no billable
        orders are found.
