# Monta Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the pursuit of fostering an open, welcoming, and inclusive atmosphere, we, as contributors and maintainers of Monta, commit to making participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone. This commitment is regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Positive behavior that contributes to a welcoming environment includes:

- Using inclusive and respectful language.
- Valuing different viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Prioritizing what is best for the community.
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting, derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Any other conduct which could be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers of Monta are responsible for setting standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable conduct.

Maintainers have the authority to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they find inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation of Monta may include using an official project e-mail address, posting through official social media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Monta project team at [Support Email](emoss@monta.io). All complaints will be reviewed, investigated, and will result in a response appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of Monta's leadership.
