# Monta Recent Application Update Announcement

Dear Users,

I am writing to inform you of an important update regarding the development of our application. After extensive
consideration, I have made the decision to transition from Mantine to a combination of ShadCN and TailwindCSS for our
application's framework. This strategic choice stems from a thorough evaluation of the technical challenges and
performance limitations we encountered with Mantine.

While Mantine has been instrumental in shaping our application's user interface, we have identified specific areas,
particularly in terms of component re-renders and hook implementations, where it falls short of our evolving
requirements. To ensure our application's continuous improvement and scalability, we believe that adopting TailwindCSS
will offer enhanced flexibility and efficiency, key factors that align with our long-term vision for the application.

This transition is not only a step towards optimizing our application's performance but also an opportunity to reimagine
our UI inspired by the best aspects of Mantine. Our goal is to deliver a more robust and user-friendly experience,
particularly for those managing transportation companies through our platform.

It is important to note that this change will also streamline our development process. The need to constantly adapt to
Mantine's evolving versions, which would have added significant development time, will no longer be a constraint.
Instead, our focus will be on leveraging TailwindCSS to expedite the release of new and innovative features, thereby
enhancing your experience and supporting your business growth.

Sincerely,

Wolfred, Creator & Maintainer
