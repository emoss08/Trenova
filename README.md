## Fair Source Licensing

Trenova operates under the Fair Source licensing model, specifically using FSL-1.1 (Functional Source License). Fair Source differs from traditional OSI-approved open source licenses, automatically transitioning to the Apache 2.0 license after a two-year period. Before this transition, the code functions essentially as open source with specific competitive restrictions in place.

Under this licensing framework, organizations and individuals are free to utilize Trenova and deploy it across any infrastructure, including enterprise environments. However, the license explicitly restricts the commercialization of self-hosted Trenova deployments - meaning you cannot offer it as a Software-as-a-Service platform or monetize it through other business models. Additionally, you cannot leverage Trenova's FSL-licensed codebase to build competing services or products.

All source code for Trenova, along with its supporting infrastructure and deployment libraries, is publicly accessible through our GitHub repositories.
