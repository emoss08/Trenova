## Vision

Trenova emerged from witnessing the daily struggles of Over-The-Road carriers in the United States. Traditional TMS solutions create significant barriers with enterprise costs often exceeding $50,000 annually, making them inaccessible to small and mid-sized carriers who comprise 90% of the industry.

We're building an AI-first Transportation Management System that:

- **Democratizes Access**: Making enterprise-grade TMS technology available to all carriers
- **Automates Operations**: Reducing repetitive tasks through intelligent workflow automation
- **Provides Real-Time Intelligence**: Delivering actionable insights when they matter most
- **Enables Innovation**: Creating open standards for transportation technology

Trenova represents a fundamental shift in how carriers manage operations, combining artificial intelligence with human expertise to create a system that truly serves its users.

## Fair Source Licensing

Trenova operates under the [Fair Source](https://fair.io/) licensing model, specifically using [Functional Source License](https://fsl.software/). Fair Source differs from traditional OSI-approved open source licenses, automatically transitioning to the Apache 2.0 license after a two-year period. Before this transition, the code functions essentially as open source with specific competitive restrictions in place.

Under this licensing framework, organizations and individuals are free to utilize Trenova and deploy it across any infrastructure, including enterprise environments. However, the license explicitly restricts the commercialization of self-hosted Trenova deployments - meaning you cannot offer it as a Software-as-a-Service platform or monetize it through other business models. Additionally, you cannot leverage Trenova's FSL-licensed codebase to build competing services or products.

All source code for Trenova, along with its supporting infrastructure and deployment libraries, is publicly accessible through our GitHub repositories.
