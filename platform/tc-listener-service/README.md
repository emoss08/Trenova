# Trenova Table Change Alert Microservice

This microservice is responsible for sending alerts to the Trenova Table Change Alert Service. It is a simple kafka consumer that listens to registered table change alert data topics generated by [Debezium](https://debezium.io/). If an action is performed on a table in the database, the microservice will send an alert to the Trenova Table Change Notification and Alert Service.

# TODO
