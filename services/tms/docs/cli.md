# Trenova CLI Documentation

## Overview

The Trenova CLI is a unified command-line tool for managing and administering the Trenova Transportation Management System. It combines all system components (API server, worker processes, database management) into a single binary, providing a comprehensive interface for system administration, development, and operations.

## Installation

### Building from Source

```bash
# Build the unified CLI binary
make build-cli

# Or build directly with Go
go build -o trenova ./cmd/cli

# The binary will be available at ./build/trenova-cli
```

### Running the CLI

```bash
# Run directly from source
go run ./cmd/cli [command]

# Or use the built binary
./build/trenova-cli [command]

# Or use make commands (which auto-build if needed)
make run               # Start API server
make run-worker        # Start worker process
make db-status         # Check database status
```

## Global Flags

These flags are available for all commands:

- `--config string` - Specify config file location (default: `config/config.yaml`)

### 6. Redis Commands

Manage Redis cache operations.

#### `redis flush`

Flush all data from the Redis cache.

```bash
trenova redis flush
```

**Purpose:** Clears all cached data from Redis. Useful for:

- Clearing stale cache after configuration changes
- Resetting cache during debugging
- Forcing fresh data loads

**Warning:** This removes ALL data from Redis, including session data, cached queries, and temporary storage.

### 7. Worker Command

Manage background worker processes.

```bash
trenova worker run               # Start worker process
trenova worker run --verbose     # Run with detailed logging
```

**Purpose:** Starts the background worker that processes:

- Async tasks
- Scheduled jobs
- Queue processing
- Workflow orchestration

**Note:** Worker configuration is read from the main config file.

## Configuration

The CLI reads configuration from `config/config.yaml` by default. You can override this with the `--config` flag.

### Configuration Structure

```yaml
app:
  name: Trenova
  version: 1.0.0
  env: development  # production, staging, development, test

db:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  name: trenova_go_db
  username: postgres
  password: postgres
  max_open: 25
  max_idle: 5
  log_queries: true  # Enable query logging in development

redis:
  host: localhost
  port: 6379
  password: ""
  db: 0

# Additional service configurations...
```

## Environment Detection

The CLI automatically detects the environment from the configuration and adjusts behavior accordingly:

- **Production:** Restrictive mode with safety checks, no destructive operations
- **Staging:** Similar to production but allows some testing operations
- **Development:** Full features, verbose output, development seeds
- **Test:** Optimized for testing, includes test-specific seeds

## Using with Make

The Makefile provides convenient shortcuts that automatically build the CLI if needed:

```bash
# Application operations
make run                # Start API server
make run-worker         # Start worker process
make dev                # Start development environment with hot reload

# Database operations
make db-migrate          # Run migrations
make db-seed            # Apply seeds
make db-reset           # Reset database
make db-setup           # Setup (migrate + seed)
make db-status          # Show status

# Seed management
make db-create-seed name=my_seed [env=dev|test]
make db-seed-sync       # Sync registry
make db-seed-check      # Check orphaned seeds
make db-seed-clean      # Clean orphaned seeds
make generate-seeds     # Regenerate seed registry

# Redis operations
make redis-flush        # Flush Redis cache

# Build operations
make build              # Build the CLI binary
make build-cli          # Build the unified CLI
make clean              # Clean build artifacts
```

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

```
cmd/cli/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go              # Entry point and root command
â”œâ”€â”€ api/                 # API server command
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ run_api.go       # API server runner

```

### Package Organization

- **Main Package:** Contains root command, version, config, search vector commands
- **API Package:** API server startup and management
- **DB Package:** All database-related commands and utilities
- **Worker Package:** Background worker process management
- **Shared State:** Configuration passed to packages via `SetConfig()`

## Error Handling

The CLI provides detailed error messages with context:

```bash
# Example error output
Error: failed to connect to database: pq: password authentication failed
  Hint: Check your database credentials in config/config.yaml
```

### Common Error Solutions

1. **"Config file not found"**
   - Ensure `config/config.yaml` exists
   - Use `--config` flag to specify location

2. **"Database connection failed"**
   - Check database is running
   - Verify credentials in config
   - Ensure network connectivity

3. **"Migration locked"**
   - Another migration is running
   - Check for stuck migration locks
   - Clear lock table if needed

4. **"Seed already applied"**
   - Seed was previously run
   - Use `--force` to re-apply
   - Check seed history with `db status`

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Initial Setup:**

   ```bash
   make quick-start     # Sets up everything
   ```

2. **Daily Development:**

   ```bash
   make db-status       # Check current state
   make db-migrate      # Apply new migrations
   make db-seed         # Apply new seeds
   ```

3. **Creating Seeds:**

   ```bash
   make db-create-seed name=feature_x env=dev
   # Edit the generated file
   make db-seed
   ```

4. **Testing Migrations:**

   ```bash
   make db-migrate --dry-run    # Preview
   make db-migrate               # Apply
   make db-rollback              # If issues
   ```

### Production Deployment

1. **Pre-deployment:**

   ```bash
   trenova config validate       # Validate config
   trenova db migrate --dry-run  # Preview migrations
   ```

2. **Deployment:**

   ```bash
   trenova db migrate            # Apply migrations
   trenova db status             # Verify state
   ```

### Seed Management

1. **Keep seeds idempotent** - Should be safe to run multiple times
2. **Use numeric prefixes** - Controls execution order (00_, 01_, 02_)
3. **Separate by environment** - Use appropriate directories
4. **Document dependencies** - Note what each seed requires

## Extending the CLI

### Adding New Commands

1. Create new file in `cmd/cli/` or `cmd/cli/db/`
2. Define command with `cobra.Command`
3. Add to parent command in init()
4. Follow existing patterns for consistency

### Command Template

```go
var myCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "my-command",
    Short: "Brief description",
    Long:  `Detailed description...`,
    RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
        // Command logic
        return nil
    },
}

func init() {
    parentCmd.AddCommand(myCmd)
    myCmd.Flags().BoolP("flag", "f", false, "Flag description")
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

Enable debug output:

```bash
export BUNDEBUG=1              # Enable Bun SQL logging
trenova db migrate --verbose   # Verbose output
```

### Checking Logs

The CLI outputs to stdout/stderr. Redirect for analysis:

```bash
trenova db seed 2>&1 | tee seed.log
```

### Performance

For large operations:

- Use `--verbose` to monitor progress
- Run migrations in batches if many pending
- Consider connection pool settings in config

## Security Considerations

- **Credentials:** Never commit config files with production credentials
- **Destructive Operations:** Protected by environment checks
- **Audit Trail:** Seed history tracks who applied what and when
- **Confirmations:** Interactive mode for dangerous operations

## Support

For issues or questions:

- Check this documentation first
- Review error messages and hints
- Enable verbose/debug mode for details
- Report issues with full command output

## Version History

The CLI version matches the main application version. Check with:

```bash
trenova version
```

Updates to the CLI are backward compatible within major versions.
